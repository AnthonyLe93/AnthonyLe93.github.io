                <p>My name is Anthony Le, I graduated from University of Bristol with a PhD in robotics. I'd really
                    describe myself as a focused, highly innovative person with a willingness to learn. I strongly
                    believe there are always better ways to do things by thinking differently; therefore, I strive
                    to add values to everything I do to achieve the best results. This mind set enabled me to win an
                    international award for my robotic hand project at a robotic design competition in Boston, USA.
                    Plus, many publications in prestigious robotic journals and conferences. I am working as a
                    software
                    engineer with expertise in autonomous systems, advanced data analytics and machine learning.</p>
                <p>I enjoy working with people and value the importance of teamwork, I think effective collaboration
                    is one of the key factors for success. Therefore, I thrive in a multifunctional team tasked
                    to build the best engineering products with real commercial impact. That is why I love working
                    for
                    multinational company with strong global presence and diverse culture
                    where I can be a part of a committed team driven to find the best solutions for engineering
                    problems
                    with a rewarding high-performance culture. Lastly, Iâ€™d like to build a long term career that
                    lets me
                    focus on both professional and personal growth. </p>

            <p>I am proud to obtain a trophy for best pattern performer from a taekwondo competition. This
                is the
                result of the hard work I put into martial art training and determination to win. It also
                shows
                that I am highly motivated and have a strong sense of self-discipline. I am also a semi-pro
                badminton player and has been representing the university of Bristol competing in the
                national
                university competitions (BUCS). I am a member of the Avon badminton county team and
                regularly compete
                in the senior county championship in England. I am also actively participating in badminton
                England ranking
                tournaments. Sports improve my flexibility, reaction speed and team playing skills. It also
                helps
                me develop interpersonal skills and broaden my relationships.</p>
