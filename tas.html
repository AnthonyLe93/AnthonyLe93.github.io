                    <p>Research at the TAS Functionality Node is focusing on evolving functionality of autonomous
                        systems and
                        how it needs to be specified, designed, verified, validated, curated and regulated to ensure it
                        is safe,
                        reliable, resilient, ethical and trustworthy. This is being achieved through a range of research
                        approaches and case studies. One of the emerging technology being investigated in the TAS
                        project is Soft
                        Robotics</p>
                    <p>A popular belief in the soft robotics community that soft robots possess ‘intrinsic safety’
                        features
                        because it is soft. While this is generally true that soft robots can be considered safer from a
                        mechanical point of view, there are several possible safety loopholes that render the robots
                        untrustworthy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike rigid robotics, where the construction material is considerably robust and is less likely
                        to fail,
                        material failure is a significant safety concern in soft robots. The most common causes of
                        material
                        failure in soft robots are Abrasion, tearing and material degradation. Abrasion, tearing
                        happened when
                        material failed or ruptured due to external influences. This is especially common in Pneumatic
                        actuators.
                        Pneumatic actuators often tend to have a ballooning effect, which is fundamental for actuation.
                        Being
                        enveloped in a covering, the ballooning is usually not directly exposed to the workspace,
                        but it may not always be possible to shield the ballooning area from the work environment. If in
                        direct
                        contact with humans, a tear could cause sudden release of the elastic energy stored in the
                        material,
                        thrusting it to a nearby object. The higher the pressure, the more likely someone will get hurt
                        if they
                        come in close contact. Imagine putting your face next to a big balloon when it burst. Material
                        Degradation
                        causes Structural changes leading to increased stiffness in elastomeric materials. This is
                        especially
                        important in medical procedure (because of change in functionality) – As such, rigorous
                        considerations
                        are required when selecting soft materials in medical procedures. </p>
                    <p>Another safety loophole is when a soft robot in dynamic mode. Impulse and whiplash effect are
                        the main safety concerns when dealing with soft robot in motion. It is quite straight forward
                        with impulse, for example a soft robot arm moving with high velocity will have a big impulse
                        when it comes in contact with an object. Regarding The whiplash effect, it could happen when a
                        soft robot moves fast or slow. I will go back to the soft robot arm example, now the robot arm
                        moves slowly, however, the velocity of the end effector may increase considerably if the arm
                        encounters an obstacle in the workspace. Imagine a complete soft arm moving from point A to
                        point B. It encounters an obstacle C at the elbow of the arm, Because the arm is soft the part
                        from the elbow the end effector bends backward whilst the part from the base to the elbow keeps
                        moving forward. After the arm move a certain distance the part that bended backwards got freed
                        and quickly bounce back to its original shape due to its elastic energy creating a whiplash
                        effect. The end effector of these arm-like manipulators are equipped with appendages such
                        as grippers or they may be carrying a payload. As such, something soft that has enough mass
                        and move fast can hurt people and cause serious damage. All these examples show that soft robot
                        may not be as trustworthy as people might think. This raises the question of how can we determine
                        what is trustworthiness in soft robots? </p>
                    <p>One possible area that we can look at in order to answer this question could be in Functionality/DoF.
                        Most conventional soft robots have High dof, high functionality and adaptability but low
                        predictability and low controllability (this means low trustworthiness). In contrast conventional
                        rigid robots have high controllability and predictability (this means high trustworthiness) and
                        limited dof and low adaptability. As such, my hypothesis is that trustworthy soft robots lies in
                        the middle between the 2 extremes and the next step is figure out how to quantify trustworthiness
                        in soft robots.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic"> Demonstration at TAS All Hands Meetings, 2022.</p>
                    <p>The SoftTAS group has been collaborating with Ocado Technology to develop a design framework for
                        trustworthy soft grippers in industrial grocery setting. Ocado's robotic experts are part of the
                        project's industrial advisory board offering top-level context and business challenges for soft
                        robotic grasping. Ocado has provided two UR10 arms to evaluate the performance of trustworthy
                        grippers developed according to the proposed design framework. The SoftTAS group has visited
                        Ocado’s Erith centre to see the systems in use from the storage and retrieval robots to human
                        packing. This helps to put our research work in context and better address the grocery handling
                        challenges. Discussions with senior management and engineers at Ocado have provided an insight
                        into Ocado’s existing system architecture and how our research work could help transform the
                        current systems to be more efficient. We also set up a SoftTAS-Ocado research bay at the BRL
                        dedicated to the development of technologies which could benefit Ocado in the future. This
                        enables further collaboration with Ocado Technology and could result in many exciting
                        research projects with real commercial impacts.

                    <h3>ReRobot: Recycled Materials for Trustworthy Soft Robots</h3>
                    <p style="font-style: italic"> Published in IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)
                        , 2022.</p>
                    <p>The ethical sourcing and disposal of materials has become ubiquitous and necessary across society.
                        However, this trend towards increased sustainability has yet to find parallels in robotics
                        research. Within the field of soft robotics, large quantities of silicones, rubbers and other
                        elastomers are used to construct the various soft bodies and actuators.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
                    <p>As the field grows, this will have a large negative impact on the environment.</p>
                    <p>In this work we propose the effective recycling of elastomeric materials, thereby reducing the
                        amount of new material needed, lowering costs and reducing the amount of harmful waste.
                        </p>
                    <p>We present a non-chemical process of elastomer recycle-and-reuse, where elastomeric material from
                        old and broken soft actuators is ground into granules ranging from ≤1 mm in diameter to 3 mm
                        in diameter and used to create new soft actuators without loss of function.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
                    <p>Characterisation tests show that although ultimate yield strain and stress reduce with the
                        percentage of recycled material, the silicone composites exhibit very comparable elastic
                        properties to the pristine silicone.
                        </p>
                    <p>This suggests an effective recycling pipeline where
                        materials are recycled into different, lower-risk, applications at each iteration. We
                        demonstrate the effectiveness of this process in a high strain recycled bladder actuator
                        and a soft gripper.</p>
