                        robots</h3>
                    <p style="font-style: italic"> Presented in TAS node in Functionality Seminar, 2022.</p>
                    <p>Due to the inherent uncertainty in soft robot systems, it is a challenge to quantify
                        trustworthiness in soft robots. In addition, there is not a universal definition for
                        what constitute as a trustworthy soft robot in the field. Bear in mind these challenges I
                        propose a
                        universal framework to calculate Trustworthiness in Soft-robots which consists of application
                        measures
                        and fundamental measures.
                        The Fundamental measures can be predictability, reliability or adaptability.
                    </p>
                    <p>Applications measures can be manipulation, exploration or medical.
                        Application measures dictate the weighting for fundamental measures of trust worthiness. i.e.
                        different application has specific requirements in terms of predictability, reliability and
                        adaptability.
                    </p>
                    <p>Manipulation → focus more strongly on predictability</p>
                    <p>Exploration → more focus on adaptability</p>
                    <p>Medical → more focus on reliability </p>
                    <p>We believe that Trustworthiness in soft robot is application driven. As such, I decided to
                        explore predictability of soft gripper in manipulation application as a first function for my
                        calculus. </p>
                    <p>I am taking a top-down approach with an initial focus on
                        predictability to describe and quantify trustworthiness. I also think that predictability might
                        be
                        inversely proportionate in certain cases to adaptability as the robot is less adaptive when
                        predictability increase.
                        To achieve this, I am going back to the basics of soft robotics and ask myself a question: what
                        is
                        the fundamental building blocks of soft robots? </p>
                    <p>Soft robots are made of soft elements that bend, twist or extend which are the fundamental
                        behaviour of soft robots. As such, I am looking at the buckling effect of cylindrical shapes
                        with different cross-sectional areas (I call these simple soft elements morphels). I choose to
                        investigate these morphels because they are simple, having a particular behaviour (bending)
                        and offer good flexibility and control. By investigate the buckling behaviour of these morphels,
                        I can hopefully quantify the trustworthiness of soft robots. I call this Calculus of
                        soft trustworthiness. </p>

                    <p>Regarding the morphels design, I have developed a function to describe a sinusoidal family
                        of shapes. This function takes perfect circle as their root, and by varying number of
                        waveforms and the magnitude of the wave amplitude, I am able to generate a range of
                        sinusoidal shapes which could output interesting buckling behaviors.
                        To be able to generate the 3D volumetric shape of these morphels, I gave these shapes
                        a wall thickness of 1mm.</p>

                    <p>This plot is showing you the average end position of the buckling of the shape depending on
                        which bias force is acting on it. Note that the colour curves are just representation of the
                        shape not the actual cross-sectional area of the buckled shape. It is clear from the plot that
                        the buckling happens at the principal axes of the shape (represent by black dotted lines) under
                        the influence of the bias forces. This is what we normally expect. However, this behaviour is
                        not quite true as the vertices and amplitude increase. I will clarify this point in the
                        next slide. </p>

                <div class="col-12-narrow">
                    <p>I decided to use SOFA because SOFA can batch process thousands of
                        possible scenarios. It is a powerful simulation tool to quickly narrow the massive search
                        space and focus on important geometries. This is a SOFA simulation set-up for the pentafoil
                        shape.</p>
                    <p>This particular shape has 5 vertices and the sinusoidal amplitude applied on the shape is 5mm.
                        The shape is fixed at one end and an axial displacement (z-axis direction) of 20mm is applied
                        to the other end to simulation compression force.</p>
                    <p>The red boxes are called region of interests or ROI boxes. They are used to applied constraint
                        and/or monitor the mechanical behaviour of the elements trapped within the region of interest
                        boxes. I used the red box in the middle to track the displacements of all the elements within
                        it because the buckling tend to happen at the middle of the cylinder.</p>
                    <p>The simulation time step is 0.1s which correspond to a displacement of 0.1mm. Currently, a
                        set of 4 simulation is run for each scenario, each simulation a small bias force of 100mN is
                        applied to all the elements within the middle ROI box to replicate imperfections cause the
                        fabrication process in real life. The bias forces are applied in plus, minus x and y
                        directions. </p>

                    <p>Here is the buckling plot of all simulated shapes. As you can see, at low vertices and
                        amplitudes the buckling tend to happen at the principal axes of the shapes. As can be
                        seen in the dotted green box, depending on the bias forces applied, the shape would buckle
                        up or down. However, as the vertices and amplitude increase, the buckling direction becomes
                        more and more independent from the bias forces applied. We can see from this dotted red box,
                        all the buckling tend to happen at the same orientation.</p>
                    <p>Bellow is a test rig build to validate the buckling behaviour of the simulated shapes. The
                        results
                        collected from the test rig seems to agree with the simulation results.</p>
