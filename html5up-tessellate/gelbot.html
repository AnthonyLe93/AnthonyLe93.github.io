                    <h3>Toward Stimuli-Responsive Soft Robots with 3D Printed Self-Healing Konjac Glucomannan Gels</h3>
                    <p style="font-style: italic"> Published in 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 2021.</p>
                    <p>Significant progress in fabricating new multifunctional soft materials and the advances of additive
                        manufacturing technologies have given birth to a new generation of soft robots with complex
                        capabilities, such as crawling, swimming, jumping, gripping, and releasing.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">

                    <p>Within this vast array of responsive soft materials, hydrogels receive considerable attention
                        due to their fascinating properties, including biodegradable, self-healing, stimuli-responsive,
                        and large volume transformation.
                        </p>
                    <p>Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is an edible polysaccharide that forms a pH-responsive, self-healing
                        hydrogel when crosslinked with borax, and it is the focus of this study.
                        A novel KGM-Borax ink for three-dimensional (3D) printing of free-form structures and soft
                        robots at room temperature is presented.
                        </p>
                        <p>A complete process from ink preparation to the fabrication of a completely cross-linked part
                        is demonstrated. Print setting parameters, rheological properties of the ink and crosslinked
                        gels were characterized. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
                    <p>Print quality was found to be consistent across a wide range of print
                        settings. The minimum line width achieved is 650Î¼m. Tensile testing was carried out to validate
                        the self-healing capability of the KGM-Borax gel.
                        </p>
                    <p>Results show that KGM-Borax has a high self-healing efficiency of 98%.
                        Self-healing underwater was also demonstrated, a rarity for crosslinked gels.
                        The means to form complex structures via 3D printing, reacting to environmental
                        stimuli and the resilience against damage, make this new KGM-Borax gel a promising candidate
                        for the fabrication of the next generation of soft robots.</p>
